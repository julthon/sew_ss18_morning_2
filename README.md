Project name: ReciPro

Project platform: TeamXtreme

## Description

ReciPro, as its name suggests, is an application centered around recipes. Users are encouraged to enter and query inserted or predefined recipes into/from our app. All users are then able to retrieve, view and save this information. 

## Test Coverage

Since we are using instrumented Espresso tests as well as JUnit tests, we use Java Code Coverage Library (JaCoCo) to create a unified code coverage report. The report can be created via the gradle task 'jacocoTestReport' and can be found in reports\jacoco\jacocoTestReport\html in the build directory.
